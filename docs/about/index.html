	<p>The New Riverside Cafe was (mostly) a vegetarian restaurant owned and operated by a collective/cooperative.</p>

<p>The Riv was founded in 1970 by Episcopal priest, Father William Teska, on the corner of 19th and Riverside
in the West Bank neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. In 1971 it moved to the corner of Cedar and Riverside in that same neighborhood.</p>

<p>In 1984 the cafe underwent a major renovation and finally succumbed to financial problems, closing in 1997.</p>
