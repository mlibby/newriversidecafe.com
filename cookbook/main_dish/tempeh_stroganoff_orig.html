<h1>TEMPEH STROGANOFF</h1>
<h2>
  The Raw Materials:
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 pkg tempeh, defrosted</li>
  <li>1 c. sour cream</li>
  <li>3 stalks celery, diced fine</li>
  <li>2 c. cups onions, “ “</li>
  <li>1 lb. mushrooms, sliced</li>
  <li>2 1/2 c. yogurt</li>
  <li>2/3 c. white flour/li>
  <li>2 T. miso</li>
  <li>1/2 lb. butter</li>
  <li>1/3 c. white wine</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Seasonings:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 bay leaves (only)</li>
  <li>2 t. celery seed</li>
  <li>1 t. paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 t. nutmeg</li>
  <li>1 t. black pepper</li>
  <li>1 t. garlic powder</li>
  <li>salt to taste</li>

</ul>
<p>
  First, take the tempeh out to defrost. When it is soft, cut it into bite-size chunks (about 1”x1 “x 3/8”)
  and marinate it in the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1/4 c. tamari</li>
  <li>2 T. olive oil</li>
  <li>3 T. white wine</li>
  <li>1 t. each marjoram, oregano, garlic powder, basil</li>
  <li>1/2 t. black pepper</li>
  <li>1/4 t. each thyme & sage (grind in spice grinder)</li>
  <li>water enough to cover chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Stir marinade well to mix spices evenly. After the tempeh has soaked for 2-3 hours, fish it out and
  bake it in oiled casserole pans for an hour at 250°. Stir around with a spatula at least once during baking
  process.
</p>
<p>
  Hold onto the leftover marinade; you'll be using it later.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in a large pot, melt the butter over a low flame. Add the flour and whisk to make a fairly thick
  roux. Add the seasonings. Allow roux to cook a little bit, keep flame very low and stir often. Add */2 cup of
  water and stir until smooth.
</p>
<p>
  Next, put the yogurt, miso and sour cream in a big bowl. Add the marinade and white wine; whisk
  until blended. Add this to the sauce in the large pot. Let heat gradually over a low flame.
</p>
<p>
  In a big skillet, with a little oil, saute onions, celery, and mushrooms. When doing the mushrooms,
  add a little white wine and a pinch of salt. When vegies are done, transfer them to the straganoff pot, juices
  and all. Let the stroganoff cook until thick. Add water or stock if it seems to be getting too thick. Don’t let it
  stick to the bottom. Lastly, add the baked tempeh.

  Stroganoff is best served over rice or egg noodles.
