<ul>

  <li>1/2 T. chili powder</li>

<h2>Cook:</h2>
<p>
  Bring to a boil until beans expand a little bit aprox. 1/2 hr. then turn down flame and keep at a soft
  boil, adding water to keep the beans just barely covered with water. stir frequently( every 15-20 min). The
  beans are done when they are completely soft and the excess water is gone. Stir them briskly with a large
  spoon in order to get the right consistency, which is not really smooth but still has evidence of bean shapes.
