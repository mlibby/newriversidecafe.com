7 Some softer fruits may require more cornstarch (or less apple juice) to achieve a thick sauce.

8. Options: We usually use strawberries or blueberries. You may use dry fruits also such as apricots (soak 1
hour in fruit juice before cooking). Add spices such as cinnamon, cloves, or nutmeg to enhance
flavors, especially for peaches , apples, or pears. For Pear Sauce add: 1/4 t. cinnamon, 1/8 t. nutmeg,
a pinch of cardamom and 1 t. lemon juice. Jeanette suggests apples & bananas with nutmeg. Also add
orange juice or other juices to enhance flavors.

CHINESE MARINATED BEAN SALAD

4c. aduki or small red beans 1/2 cup. wine vinegar
3 apples, sliced 2cups mung bean sprouts
2 med. yellow onions, diced fine 1 Tbl. five-spice
1/2 cup cilantro, chopt fine
2 Tbl peppermint tea 1 tsp pepper
(or fresh mint) salt or tamari to taste
juice of 2 lemons
1/2 cup O.J.concentrate
1 cup. prepared OJ

Sort, wash, and cover beans with water in a pot. Cook until they are soft, about an hour..
Drain in colander, then refrigerate in plastic tub while you prepare the rest When preparing
other ingredients heed the following tips: 1) Apples will discolor rapidly, so use either your
lemon juice or some OJ to help keep them fresh-looking as you slice them aside in a bowl. 2)Mix
OJ concentrate, vinegar, lemon, ginger, and spices with a whisk; this is your dressing. You may
use some tamari in the dressing, in place of some of the salt (above), but don’t substitute
completely. The strong taste of the tamari will detract from the other flavors of the salad. 3)
Mung bean sprouts should be steamed lightly, either in wok or the skillet, with a little water, and
a lid to cover them. Boil water first, then toss in sprouts & cover. Stir once or twice. This should
only take a couple of minutes, you want your sprouts to stay slightly crunchy.

Mix all ingredients together in a big bowl. Taste for salt, and adjust other seasonings if
you like. Refrigerate, serve cold.

milder seasoning—go for it!!! Try different beans, too.

GREEK SALAD

30 tomatoes, cut into wedges

8 sliced cucumbers

10 green peppers, diced

10 mild small onions (I use red )

8 bunches parsley

5T olive oil

21 white or red wine vinegar

1/4 cup marjorem or oregano

salt and pepper

4 lbs feta cheese (this recipe can be nondairy by skipping this cheese)

black olives (I don’t use them unless they are really Greek olives)

Toss everything together in Bertha or two large bowls.

INDIAN CUCUMBER SALAD
(NON-DAIRY)

5 cucumbers

3 apples

1 bunche scallions, chopped
1 cup fresh cilantro, ” ”
1/2 cup fresh mint, ” “
or1T peppermint tea
juice of 3 lemons

Dash ofwhite pepper

1/2 cup orange juice

1 Tbl fresh ginger, grated
1/4 cup wine vinegar

1 cup raisins

salt (for cukes, then to taste)

1 tsp cardomon

Itsp five-spice

Peel cucumbers, score lengthwise with fork to decorate, slice fairly thin. Sprinkle salt over them and set
aside for at least 1/2 hour. Later, rinse with cold water and drain. This procedure leaches excess juice out of
the cucumbers, thereby helping your salad to stay fresh-looking over the course of the day.

Core and slice apples. Pour the lemon juice and OJ over them as you go,to keep discoloration at a
minimum while you work. Combine with all other ingredients and the prepared cucumbers. Taste. Adjust

RAITA
(INDIAN YOGURT-DRESSED SALAD)

salt and other seasonings as you like.

It’s Koooool in the summertime...
and oh-so-refreshing with hot curry plates!

1 pint yogurt

1/4 cup orange juice concentrate
juice of 3 limes

salt to taste

dash ofwhite pepper

1 tsp ground cloves

(1 tsp. cardamom, optional)
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped

5 cucumbers

3 carrots sliced

New RIvERSIDE CAFE COOKBOOK — DRAFT — PAGE 8
Unwaxed cukes may be used as they are, or decoratively scored or striped before slicing. Slices should be
fairly thin, sprinkle them with salt . This leaches out the excess juice and allows the cukes to hold up better in
your salad.
Rinse anddrain cucumber slices and taste one for saltiness
Mix yogurt, lime juice, OJ concentrate, spices, and chopped cilantro together.

mix vegies and dressing thoroughly.
Taste and adjust seasoning as needed to complement your dish best.

II. Sometimes you will see raita in restaurants which is made with only cucumbers, or only carrots.
Commonly they are more yogurt-y than this recipe is. You’re of course free to innovate, but bear in mind that
if the raita is too soupy it will have to be served in a cup. A lot of authentic cucumber raitas use grated
cucumbers. If you want to try this, you will need a LOT
of cukes —probably a whole case, so if we ever have a surplus...

The technique is: grate cukes in Robotcoupe or Hobart, using coarse grater. Salt the shreds liberally and
allow to stand at least 30 minutes. Then rinse and let drain thoroughly. Applying pressure (a heavy weight)
is helpful. Then proceed to make your dressing and mix all together as in the first variation.

CREAM OF YAM

5 to 6 Good sized yams or sweet potatoes
1/2 half gallon of milk

2 pts. 1/2 &1/2

2 Tbl. ground rosemary

2 Tol. chinese five spice

1 tsp. cinnamon

salt to taste

extra milk to thin if desired

This is a simple recipe but it takes awhile so plan ahead.

First, peel and wash the potatoes. Place them in a pot and cover with half of the liquids.
Cook on medium heat until potatoes are soft.

Mash the potatoes with a potato masher until you can use a whisk to smooth them.
Add the spices.

Let it simmer and add the rest of the mild and cream slowly. Careful not to burn it.

CUBAN BLACK BEAN SOUP

Makes 1 gallon: serves 6-8.

J. black beans, dry 1/2+ pepper
11/26 chopped onions 1t. coriander
3-cloves garlic Dit cumin
27. olive oil 11/2t. turmeric
2 big carrots, diced, or sliced 1 bay leave
1 stalk celery, diced 1T. chili powder
1/2. tomato paste 1/4t. cayenne
1/2c OJ (more, if you want) 1/8 t. cloves
juice ofllime 1/8t. cinnamon

1T. honey 1/8 t. sage

2 t. salt

Put olive oil in pot. Saute onions and garlic till clear and tender. Sort and wash beans. When onions
are done, add tomato paste, seasonings, and a little water; stir until well-blended. Let cook a little while,
taking care not to let the mixture stick to the bottom of the pot. Next, add water or stock to pot until it’s about
half-full. Add beans. Bring to a boil, then cover and turn down to simmer.

Prep your vegetables.

You should let the beans cook at least 1 1/2 hours, or until they are somewhat tender, before adding
the vegies. Check the pot occasionally to make sure there is enough water. This is a thick soup but, as the
beans are cooking, you should be able to stir them easily; they shouldn’t be choking the pot & getting dried
up on top. You can add the OJ now if you like, but save the lime juice till the very end.

Taste the broth. Adjust the seasoning the way you like it. As written above, this soup is not
extremely hot, but it has a kick to it. (Remember that cayenne and pepper get stronger, the longer they cook).
It’s also supposed to be rather sweet. If you want more tang, add extra OJ, some tomato sauce, (paste is bitter
—you don’t want too much of it in the soup), or some extra lime juice. You may want more salt, or more
honey. Trust your palate and have fun.

Add celery and carrots all at once, stir into soup. Replace lid and allow to simmer until beans are
well-done, and even beginning to break down. Vegies should be quite soft, too (test a carrot chunk). This
means probably another 1 1/2 hours. Keep a watchful eye on the soup, stirring now and then, and adding
more liquid if you think it necessary. It’s supposed to be THICK. When soup is done, remove from stove.
Add lime juice, stir well. Cool down and refrigerate promptly, if not serving right away.

CURRIED CREAM OF CARROT WITH CASHEWS

4 Potatoes Spices:

8 carrots, sliced Lik curry powder
1/2¢. green peppers 1/2. t. nutmeg

Le. onions dash of cayenne
1/4c¢. celery at cumin

4 cloves fresh garlic dst salt

4c. milk

1/2c. heavy cream
1/2 c. cashews
3 T. butter

First, wash potatoes and cut off any bad spots. Place in pot and cook them until they are very
soft. They should cooking while you are preparing the rest of the soup. Peel and slice the carrots
and put them into a pot with water and cook them until they are very soft. While they are
cooking,

mince the garlic and onions, and chop the peppers and celery into smallish pieces. If you want
the soup to be chunk-less, you can omit the peppers and celery and just make a pureed soup.

When the potatoes are really soft, so that the skins are peeling off, drain them. The carrots
should be done now too; drain them. In a blender, add some potaoes and some carrots, and a
little milk. Puree this mixture until smooth, doing small batches until all the potatoes and carrots
are pureed. Put the puree into a soup pot. Saute the garlic, onions, in butter in a separate pan
until onions are transluscent. Add peppers and celery and a little water. Add spices and let
simmer for 5 minutes on very low heat, covered.

While vegies are simmering, put cashew pieces on an oiled baking sheet and roast for 5-10
minutes until brown. When done, you can either grind them up (in a spice grinder or use a
morter and pestle or a blender.), or add the pieces as they are to give the soup a slightly crunchy
consistency.

Add vegies and cashews to the puree. Lastly, add the rest of the milk and heavy cream.
The thickness of the soup depends on you. If you like a really thick soup, don’t add as much milk
and cream. If you want a thinner soup, add more. Adjust spices to your liking.

First, the beans. You can either soak the beans then cook them or just put them on
the stove on a low flame. If you use the soak-cook method, put all the beans in a big pot
and add add water, twice the volume of the beans . Let soak for a few hours. Then put on
the stove and simmer until soft. If you want to save time, just put the beans and water on a
low flame and simmer for about 2 hours. Beans are hard to over-soften if left simmering
However, keep an eye on them.

In a large deep pot, saute the onions, peppers and spices in the olive oil. When the
vegies are soft, add the tomato paste and the diced tomatoes.

Allow this mixture to simmer for awhile on a low flame. Stir frequently. Add water
if if seem sto be too thick, and tending to stick to the bottom. Ajust water according to how
thick you want your chili to be.

Add the cooked beans next. Allow to simmer until good and hot. Taste for salt and
sweetness. You may want to use tamari in place of salt, if you like. Stir frequently, adding
water if you need to. Last of all, add frozen corn.

This is great with our Riverside Cornbread, dairy or non-dairy.

TOMATO-CASHEW BISQUESOUP

Makes 1 gallon; serves 6-8 persons.

2T. olive oil or butter SEASONINGS:

217/3¢. chopped onions

4 cloves garlic, minced 1T. salt (then to taste)
1/2 white flour i bay leaf

1/2 <. white wine 3/4 t. cinnamon

1/4c¢. red wine 1T. basil

11/4 lb. can tomato paste 1/2. T. cumin

11/4 lb. can tomato sauce 1/2 T. coriander

11/4 lb. can diced tomatoes 1t. white pepper

1/3 gallon milk 3/4 t. nutmeg

11/2c. cashews it: tarragon, ground
21/2¢c. water 1t. celery seed.,“ “ “
1 bunch of scallions, chopped fine LT. honey(opt.)

Saute onions and garlic in the olive oil or butter. When they are clear and tender, add the
flour, and whisk to make a roux. If you cannot get all the flour worked in, you may add a little more oil or
butter. Add seasonings to the roux; allow to cook awhile, using low flame

Add wine and tomato products; mix well with whisk. Add water.and let heat up,
stirring frequently. Then begin adding milk gradually, as this “base” thickens; you mustn’t allow it to stick
to the bottom.

Take the cashews and, in small batches, process them with milk and water in a Cuisinart or a blender, till
they turn into a smooth, creamy substance that resembles an extra-thick milkshake (the kind that has lots of
ice-cream in it). Add this cashew cream to your soup.

Once all the milk has been added, let soup heat till it reaches near-boiling point. (Do not actually boil!)
Remember to stir frequently! If more liquid seems in order, use water. The consistency should be like good
ol’ Cream 0’ Tomato Soup when it’s done. Taste for saltiness; add the honey if you think soup needs more
sweetness.

Just before serving, add the chopped scallions.

BLACK BEAN N’ TOFU BURRITOS
(NON-DAIRY)

Prepare: Classic Enchilada Sauce. Add 3 cups diced tomatoes to the recipe, and an twice the amount of
tomato sauce, if you like your sauce real tomato-ey. Also use 2 T of BEER (we ain’t jokin’) in place of some of
the water. Add 1 T. of minced jalepenos for extra kick (saute with spices & onions, when you begin the
sauce).

LT; minced jalepenos

Black beans are a hard bean and take a long time to cook. Either soak for 3 hours, then simmer till soft (1
hour) or just simmer for 3-3 1/2 hours until soft.
Then sautee the onions and peppers. Set these aside when done. When beans are soft, mash them or until
they are of refried-bean consistency.
Drain tofu. Prepare the dressing. Oil a casserole pans lightly, and crumble the tofu into them. Pour dressing
over the tofu and bake about an hour at 250°. Stir up once or twice while baking, to brown it evenly. When
done, it will be slightly crispy, and probably remind you of sausage or hamburger.
Start your sauce while the tofu bakes and the vegies saute.
When all the above steps have been completed, you can set-up for assembly. Arrange containers about you
to hold: beans, sauteed vegies, baked tofu. Lay tortillas down ona table. On each one, put:

1/2 cup (4 0z) beans

rounded 1/4 cup baked tofu

1/4 cup sauteed vegies
Roll burritos up and line snugly in a row ina greased casserole pan. Repeat process for a second row
Bake at 275° for 1/2 hour —no lids or foil wrap necessary.

further. Add to the mixture in the large bowl once you've shaken out excess water. With your hands, blend
all ingredients thoroughly, including seasonings. Taste and adjust (esp. for salt) as you think necessary. You
should now start the Sour Cream Tomato Sauce.

How to deal with the cabbages: When water comes to a rolling boil, take the cabbage (after discarding rough
outer leaves), and simply drop it into the pot. Cover the pot and allow it to come back up to a boil (use full
flame). Let cabbage simmer for about ten minutes, or until outer leaves begin to get yellowish. You want to
cook the cabbage head about 2/3 of the way through, so if it still looks firm, with that characteristic “milky”
coloration, it’s not ready yet. When it’s ready, fish it out with a stout spoon, Chinese mesh strainer, or other
tool of your choice. Have a colander set in a bowl ready to receive it. Bring to sink and rinse with cold water.
Check your sauce!

Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’... Spread some clean dry towels on your table. Take the cabbage and use a paring knife
to dig out the stem. This will free the first couple of layers of leaves. You can pretty easily push them off the
head if you do so from the base of their main veins. If the vein is very woody, excise it with the paring knife.
Put about 1/3 cup filling in the center of the leaf and roll that little dogie up as tight as you can. Place in an
oiled casserole pan. Before baking, pour about a cup of water over the rolls. This will allow them to steam as
well as bake while they’re in the oven.

Bake for 35-40 minutes, covered, at 275° till good and steamy-hot.

CALZONE

(Italian Dinner Pastry)

Sauce: FILLING:
(See basic Italian Sauce) 11/4 Ib. frozen spinach

1 lb. mushrooms, sliced
Dough:(need 2 batches) 1 Ib.. mozzerella, grated
For each batch: 1c. onions, finely chopt
Sponge: 1/2 head of garlic, minced
1T. yeast 11/21b. ricotta cheese
1/4c. water at 115° 1c. romano cheese
1t.. honey juice of 1/2 of a lemon
DOUGH PROPER: butter for sauteeing
3 T.. honey 11/2 t.. each salt, pepper, oregano
1c. lukewarm water 2 t. basil
3 T.. olive oil 1/2t nutmeg
1t. salt
11/2¢. WW pastry flour
L1i/2¢. unbl. white flour

The night before: Take spinach out of freezer to defrost. Assign some vegie chopping or cheese grating to a
prep person.

New RIVERSIDE CAFE COOKBOOK — DRAFT — PAGE 15
In the moring, come in early Start dough. For each batch, dissolve the yeast in the 1 1/2 c. water with 2 T.
honey, inasmall bowl. Allow to stand until it develops a good foamy “head”. In the Hobart bowl, put
honey, water, olive oil, and salt as listed above under “Dough Proper”. Add yeast sponge, then increments
of four, mixing on speed #1, using the dough hook. Add additional white flour as needed. Dough should be
smooth, soft and elastic and will clean the sides of the mixing bow] when sufficient flour has been added.
Allow machine to continue kneading for 5 minutes. Turn dough out into an oiled steel workbowl and cover
with a clean plastic trash bag or clean damp towels. Allow to rise 60-90 minutes, then punch down. Dough is
ready to use after this first proofing.

Start sauce (see separate recipe)

To make filling, first drain spinach in colander and squeeze out as much excess juice and water as
you can. Saute onions and garlic in butter inthe big skillet. Prep whatever things remain to be prepped. Mix
all ingrediants in Big Bertha along with spices. Put in tubs and refrigerate till needed.

To assemble: grab a fistful of dough ( about 1/2 c) and roll out on floured surface into a round
approx,. 6-7” in diameter, and 1/4 ” thick. Place about 2/3 c. filling on lower half and fold upper half over.
Crimp edges with fork, or in fluted style, using fingertips. Prick top with fork a few times. Bake ten to a pan,
don’t forget to oil the pan first.

Bake 30 minutes uncovered, in convection oven set at 300° -325°. Brush with melted butter upon
removal from oven. Store ready-to-bake calzone in reach-in, covered with waxed paper and foil—or saran
wrap (cheaper!), if you can get it to stay on tightly. It’s important that the dough not be allowed to dry out.

Serve each calzone with a 4-oz. ladle of sauce, and salad.

CANNELONI

See recipe for Manicotti. You will be using, once again, 12 manicotti shells, and preparing them in the same
manner. The filling, too, is the same.

The difference lies in the sauce you will make. Canneloni requires two sauces. Make these both first
thing in the morning, while, waiting for your noodle water to come to a boil.

Tomato Sauce: 4c. tomato sauce
1c. diced tomatoes
2 T. olive oil
11/4c. finely diced carrots
2 stalks finely diced celery
1/3 of an onion, ditto
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 T.each oregano, marjoram
1/4 t.. crushed chilis
1/4 t.black pepper
salt to taste (start with 1/2 t..)

Sautee onions, garlic,celery, and carrots in olive oil until onions are translucent. Add the crushed
chilies, allow to cook a little while. Then add all tomato products and bring up to boiling point. Add
seasonings and turn down to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until you need to use it.

Cream Sauce: 4c. milk (room temp)
1/4 lb. butter
1/2 head of garlic, minced
1c. white flour
1 t. rosemary (most effective if ground up)
1 T. oregano
11/2t.. salt
2-3 c. hot water

New RIVERSIDE CAFE COOKBOOK — DRAFT — PAGE 16
Melt butter in botton of 5-gal. soup-pot. Add garlic and saute (careful not to burn!). Add flour and
other seasonings: whisk into thick roux. Let cook over very low flame (use flame-tamer) for about five
minutes, stirring and whisking often. Slowly, add milk, whisking sauce until smooth after each addition.
Bring up to an almost-boil slowly, on low heat, remembering to whisk often. When sauce begins to thicken,
add the hot water (as with the milk, gradually! There’s always a margin of error, it seems, with a cream
sauce. You want this to be thick, so don’t add any more water than you need).

Attend to your noodles. (see Manicotti recipe)

Make your filling......

Everything’s ready, so start rolling. Like the Manicotti, the Canneloni are laid on a layer of tomato
sauce, two rows of twelve to a casserole pan. They are covered with about 5 c. of tomato sauce, then topped
with two stripes of the cream sauce, a stripe down the center of each row.. (about 4c. sauce). Sprinkle with

romano cheese.
Bake covered at 375° for 25 monutes, then remove lid and bake an additional five minutes.
Two Canneloni per serving, with salad, and bread.

SUGGESTIONS: Try using less spinach sometime; add some sauteed mushrooms, or some toasted
chopped almonds ——or both!

eocee ° Altogether, you'll need about 10 c. romano cheese for this recipe, as opposed to 4 c. for Manicotti.

CURRIED STUFFED EGGPLANT

6 eggplants (must be small)
2 C.. nuts (pecans plus some other)
3 chopt onions
11/4 lb.. mushrooms
3c. rice, dry (mix brown& wild, or basmati & wild)
3/4 head of cauliflower, small bits blanched
11/4c. frozen green peas
13/4 lb tofu ricotta
11/4 lb. potatoes, diced small, boiled
Sauce:

see Tofu Vegie Cream Curry recipe, Can be made either dairy or non-dairy. For dairy use milk, or yogurt
instead of soymilk. You could also do a tomato curry sauce (see old Red Raga).

Start your rice (same procedure as for Stuffed Squash). Saute onions and mushrooms
in a little oil and set aside. Prepare potatoes and blanch califlower. Prepare eggplants by slicing in half,

scooping out insides, and baking at 350° for 10 minutes. Roast nuts at the same time, let cool, and chop finely.

Prepare Tofu Ricotta (see separate recipe) and refrigerate immediately. Begin the sauce you choose to make.
When rice is done, add all ingrediants together (except Tofu Ricotta). When eggplants have cooled
sufficiently, qq

In a big skillet, saute mushrooms with a little olive oil and salt. Drain when the are done, and put
aside. When onions and peppers are cooked, add the red wine, the seasonings, and your tomato products,
thinning with water as needed. Don’t thin too much; the sauce has to be thick and keep low flame. Slice
eggplant in rounds no more than 1/2” thick. Break and scramble the eggs. Dip each piece of eggplant in the
eggs, then coat with crumbs. Place on an oiled baking sheet (olive oil recomended) and bake35 minutes at
400° until soft and squishy when prodded. Save the leftover bread crumbs; you'll be using them later.

Mix remaining scrambled eggs with the ricotta cheese, and throw ina little of the romano and a dash
of nutmeg. Set aside.

Check your sauce; and add sauteed mushrooms and grated carrots. Taste for saltiness and balance of
flavours. You may add some tamari if you think it should be saltier, or just plain salt.

To assemble: Use a deep casserole pan. Oil first, then lay in:

a couple of ladles sauce (spread over pan bottom)

15 eggplant slices

sprinkling of jack& mozz & romano

blops of ricotts glop (even but spare distribution)

3/4t.. white pepper

11/2t.. salt

(fresh basil, chopt, opt.)

Take spinach out to thaw the afternoon before.

Leave instructions for the prep person to chop the vegies you'll need.

Set a 5-gal. pot of water on the stove to boil, lightly oiled& salted. This is for cooking noodles. Start
your sauce. It will be basically a heavy cream sauce, so preceed as with any sauce of that type: melt the butter
in a 5-gal. soup pot, saute the 10 c. of onions, garlic, and spices theirin. Whish in flour to form a very thick
roux. Use the flame-tamer. Cook the roux over a very low flame for a little while before adding milk
gradually. You may heat the milk to room temerature in a separate pot first, if you wish or simly add it
cold—whichever method works best for you and fits in with your schedule of tasks. Lwave enough time, in
any case, for the sauce to come to an almost boil SLOWLY., without scorching. Whisk frequently. If started
early enough, it will thicken up by the time you need it. When you feel it’s done, add the grated romano or
swiss cheese & whisk in well, till melted. Taste for salt and other seasonings.

Saute the other 15 c. of onions (for filling) in the big skillet with a little butter or olive oil.

Cook noodles for about 10 minutes, until tender but still a bit chewy. It’s best to do these in two
batches, 10 lb. at a time. Carry the whole pot to the sink and dump in the footed colander. Rinse noodles
with cold water. Drain well, then oil lightly and set aside. Refill pot with water, oil, salt, start again.

You'll need to drain the aspinach also, and SQUEEZE as much excess juice & water out of it as you
can.

In oiled casserole pans, first ladle a little sauce over the bottom. Then arrange on top of that:

1 layer cooked noodles

a few c. mozzarella cheese
tomatoes

sauteed onions

Set a 5-gal. pot of water on the stove to boil, lightly oiled & salted. This will be for cooking noodles.

Start the sauce. Saute onions, peppers & spices in the olive oil in the bottom of another 5-gal. pot.
Use flame-tamer to prevent sticking and burning. Add tomato products, along with a little water and

2 bay leaves

2 T. honey
Allow to come to a boil., turn down flame and let simmer, adding water as needed to make sauce the right
consistency—it should be almost as thick as pizza sauce. Taste, and adjust seasonings if you think necessary.

Saute the green peppers and onions which will go in the filling. Use big skillet and a little olive oil or
butter.

Cook noodles for about 10 minutes, till tender but still a bit chewy. It’s best to do these in two
batches, 5 lb. at a time. Carry the while pot to the sink and dump in the footed colander. Rinse noodles with
cold water. Drain well, then oil lightly and set aside. Refill pot with water, oil, salt, start again.

Break the 120 eggs into a tub and beat well. Add the spices you reserved in the beginning (1 1/2 cups
worth, remember?). Now take two large steel bowls and crumble 10 lb. ricotta cheese into each. Divide the
eggs and the sauteed peppers & onions between them Mix well.

To assemble: In a well-oiled casserole pan, spread first:
two 6-0z. ladles sauce, then arrange as follows:

1 layer noodles

1 layer ricotta-egg mixture

water—enough to makel/2 gallon

Sautee onions and garlic in bottom of pot with the oil. Add mushrooms, saute awhile. Add wine.
Bring up to boil, turn to simmer. Add tomato paste and spices, then water to desired consistency, which
should be just a little thinner than pizza sauce.

Bring a large pot of salted water (with a splash of oil) to a boil. In this water, cook 12 manicotti shells.
You can get this project going while you are working on the sauce and /or the filling. Cook only until slighty
tender, then fish them out with the big-mesh strainder or drain them into colander. Rinse with cold water, oil
i lightly, and store in refrigerator. (Don’t store in immersed in water, they get too mushy).

Make filling in large bowl:
: 3:1/2-<Ib.. ricotta cheese

To assemble manicotti, slit noodles lengthwise, thus:
It helps to lay them out on a clean dry towel as you work. Portion 4 oz. onto each noodle. Roll up,
lay in rows ona thin layer of the tomato sauce in an oiled casserole pan. You should have 2 rows of

manicotti. Artfully ladle sauce over the manicotti; sprinkle with a little mozzarella or jack cheese. Bake

white flour, as needed, to bind filling
1/2t. salt, then to taste =
1/2t. pepper

butter or oil for saute
(white wine, if desired, for mushroom saute) J

Cream Sauce:

1/4c¢. butter 1/8 t. cloves

3/4c. white flour 1/2: nutmeg *.
up to 6c. milk ia: dijon mustard

1t. salt, then to taste Wf 2 t. paprika

1/2 t. white pepper (honey, opt., to sweeten)

water, if necessary, to thin sauce

Start by hard-boiling the eggs. As this happens, sautee the mushrooms, onions & garlic, celery, cabbage right a
away ina big skillet. (Drain the mushrooms when they’re done cooking.) Rinse the dried mushrooms and put
in a saucepan with water. Cover and bring to a boil, then simmer, for at least 20 minutes. Drain.

Next, start the sauce. Melt the butter, whisk in flour to make roux. As roux cooks over low flame, get sauce
seasonings together and add them. When roux has cooked a little while, begin adding the cold milk
gradually. Whisk sauce often and keep on low or medium-low flame to bring up to near-boiling point. It
won't get thick till it’s good and hot, so allow yourself time, be patient, don’t add extra flour or cornstarch
unless absolutely necessary. If you’re adding milk gradually, you can watch the sauce thicken gradually, and —
you should have no problems. _

When eggs are hard-boiled, rinse well with cold water and put some ice on top; this makes peeling them a lot
easier. Put eggs in a workbowl, add the sour cream and the filling seasonings. Use a pastry blender to chop
and mash to egg-salad consistency. Dried ‘shrooms, once cooked, must be fine-chopped by hand also. Put
everything for the filling in a large bowl. Mix all filling ingredients thoroughly. Add some white flour if
mixtureseems to be generating too much liquid.

Assembly: Pull out a lump of dough and divide into small balls (4 1/2- 50z). Flour your table surface* and
roll dough in approx. 8" rounds. Brush lightly with oil. Put 2/3 cup filling on each round, fold over in semi-
circular shape and crimp edges with fingers. Poke a few holes in the tops with a fork, place in an oiled
casserole pan. It’s a good idea to let the pirogis sit at room temp. for 20 minutes or so before baking (allows
bread to rise again).. Bake uncovered at 275° for 40 minutes, or until golden-brown. Brush with melted
butter and serve with sauce over top.

*If the dough recipe you choose doesn’t have poppy-seeds in it, I suggest sprinkling a few on the table as
you're rolling out your dough. They’re decorative as well as tasty, and add a note of authenticity to this
eastern European-inspired dish. —CB

PECAN SCALLOPINI

( A very versative recipe that may be used as stuffing for eggplant or squash
formed into loaves, patties, or “meatless balls”, or simple baked and crumbled to resemble browned
hamburger or sausage which may be added to a spaghetti or lasagna sauce.)

1/2 loaf whole wheat bread UT. basil

2 t/i2c, pecans 1T.. oregano

1/2 head garlic, minced very fine lets pepper

26. onions, chopt ete: marjoram

1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopt 1t. tarragon (ground)
3/4 lb.. jack cheese, grated 1/2... rosemary (ground)
11/4c. romano cheese 1/2 t.. sage

3-4 eges 2 celery seed

1/2¢. milk (more if needed) salt to taste

2/3 cx. ketchup

Cut bread (if not already sliced) lengthwide in 1” thick pieces. Place directly on oven racks (0 on wire-mesh
bakers’ racks) and bake at 300° in the convection oven (or 400° in the Bulcan) for 30-40 minutes until very
hard and dry but not burnt. Pre-sliced bread will bake quicker. 20 min. or so. Allow to cool awhile, then
grind through the Hobart to reduce to crumbs.

Roast nuts on big baking sheets—10 min. or less in either of the ovens (above temps. are OK). Let
cool.

Chop onions very finely by hand, or send large chunks through the Cuisinart for a few seconds (you
don’t want puree, just a very fine mince)

Peel garlic and use Cuisinart to mince it. It’s OK if the garlic comes out almost pureed.

Chop parsley, also quite fine; grate cheese, break & beat eggs, gather remaining ingredients.

Use Cuisinart again to chop the nuts. You want to get small, uniform chunks, like a very coarse meal,
but don’t let let them go to the point where the oil starts coming out and you’be got nut-butter! Whenever
using the Cuisinart for something like this, you have to stand by it and watch.. Use a rubber spatula to move
contents of the drum around if they are getting chopt unevenly.

Combine all ingredients in Big Bertha. It’s a sensible procedure to be cautious with liquids: I never
add the full amount to begin with. Just add Most of the wet ingredients, and stir the mixture to see what kind
of consistency you have. Keep in mind that the scalloppini should be stiff enough and moist enough to be
formed into balls or patties that could be made up and stored without falling apart. Try making a “meatless
Ball’. If it works, your scalloppini is ready to use.

How to use:

For Meatless balls,: first make 1 1/2 times this recipe, use a purple or red-handled scoop to measure,
form into balls. Roll in a mixture of cornmeal and flour for added crispness. Bake in oiled casserole pans. It
should take about 40 minutes in a 250° convection oven. Use a spatula to move them around once or twice
while baking, so they will brown evenly. Put 2 or 3 balls on each serving of spaghetti, depending on which
size Scoop you use.

For Mom’s Meatless Loaf: Make twice this recipe, use walnuts instead of pecans, and leave out Italian
seasonings. Spread out in oiled casserole pan, brush tops with ketchup, cover, and bake at 275° in the
convection oven 30 min. Remove cover and bake about 20 min. longer.

Cut 3x5. Serve with mashed potatoes and gravy, salad, and/or side veggie.

For Scallopini Spaghetti Sauce: Put mixture loosely in oiled casserole pans and bake at 250° in the
convection oven about 40 min. Because there is cheese, etc, in the recipe, it is very important to take a spatula
and break it up and turn it over a couple of times while it bakes. It should resemble browned ground meat
when done, crispe, and broken into very small chunks. If you don;t remember this step, you will have a solid
mass of stuff that is still undesirable moist inside. , and which you'll have to break up with your fingers. Take
finished baked scallopini and add it to your favorite Italian sauce just before serving over pasta, or using to
make Lasagna. NB: To create a true Scalloppini Sauce, you must have mushrooms (10 Ib. sliced, sauteed) in
it and red wine.

 

New RIVERSIDE CAFE COOKBOOK — DRAFT — PAGE 24
For Scalloppini Patties: Use a 5-oz. scoop to measure, and form patties about 3/4 “” thick. Dust with
flour and cornmeal, and stack in a yogi with pieces of wax paper between patties. This is a short-order item
which will require the services of your line cooks. The patty is served with pasta, tomato sauce, and salad or
side-veggie

Stuffing for Vegies: Make 1 1/2 x this recipe

It we're short on pecans, you may use half this amount and fill out the recipe with walnuts, filberts, or
almonds. For a Greek recipe (meatless Gyroes or Souvlaki?—Short order item), you chould use some pine
nuts in the recipe.

1/3 gallon soymilk 11/2t.. cardamon
3/4 ¢. white flour 1/4c.. wine vinegar
1 iy2 ee: apple juice

Indian Cuke Salad goes well with this.

Put half of oil in a pot. Saute half the ginger and garlic in it, using low flame. Mix up the seasonings
(except vinegar) and add half of them to the pot. Stir well and let simmet a little while. Add half the onion
chunks and cook till very tender. Add some flour (up to 1/2 of what is called for) and stir till mixed in
thoroughly.

Now add half the apple juice, half the vinegar, stir. Allow to heat up gradually, it will thicken as it
does so.

Scrub the potatoes, cut in 1” cubes, and put on stove to boil. After water comes to a boil, turn down
to simmer, and cook till tender (about 25-30 minutes). Put a smaller pot on the stove with water and salt in it.
Cover and bring to a boil This will be for blanching your cauliflower.

Check sauce; add soymilk a bit at a time, stirring frequently. If it seems too thick in the final stages,
you may use water, or reserved potato water, to thin it But it’s important that the curry not be thinned too
much.

When blanching water comes to a boi, dump cauliflower pieces into ti and cover p[ot. Check it often
and be aware when it comes to a boil. Once it boils, only let it cook one or two minutes longer. Then drain
quickly in a colander, and rinse the cauliflower with cold water to prevent its cooking any more. Set it aside.

When potatoes are done, drain them also, reserving the cooking water if you plan to use it. Add half
the potatoes to your pot of curry.

When all the soymilk has been added to your curry, plus any additional liquids you wish to add, and
it’s gotten good and hot, taste it and adjust seasonings as you like them. Especially pay attention to the
balance of salt and sweet.

Lastly, add the blanched cauliflower and frozen peas to your pot. This is great over brown rice, or a
mixture of basmati and wild rice.

3¢. cooked onions 2t. thyme
3c. ricotta cheese 4 t. basil

2. feta cheese 1 t. salt

1 head garlic (run thru food processor 1 T.)

2t. pepper (1 ea. blk & wh.)

7/4c, lemon juice

2t. dill

1/A¢. white flour

1 pkg. filo dough

18 eges

First, take filo and spinach out to thaw.

Then, saute onions and garlic in skillet with olive oil and thyme. . Drain the spinach
in a colander, and squeeze out as much of the excess as you can. Juice the lemons. Combine all of these things
(except the filo) in a large bowl.

Take out your ricotta cheese and crumble it into a bowl. Add beaten eggs; with a wire whisk, mix
cheese and egg into a smooth, slightly fluffy, quiche-like batter. Add all the other spices to this mixture. Add
it to the first large bowl along with crumbled feta. If this mixture seems too wet (if you think it will make
your filo pastry soggy), add 1/4-1/2 cup white flour and mix well. It will interact with the eggs & cheese to
make filling more custardy.

Melt butter. With a pastry brush, brush melted butter evenly over entire bottom and sides of a
shallow casserole pan. Arrange leaves of filo pastry according to handy visual aid below. Each leaf must be
buttered where it’s going to come in contact with another leaf. Lay a few additional leaves over the bottom
for good measure before putting a 3/4 “ layer of filling in the pan. Cover filling by folding buttered leaves
over it. Lay a few additional leaves over that, then repeat the entire process. Your second layer can be
somewhat thinner than the first.

Bake at 400° for 45 minutes covered, and 15 minutes uncovered.(it may take a little longer). When it
is done, the middle will be puffed way up, and the whole top will be a rich golden brown.

Good served with salad or tabouleh.

20 c. onion, chopt in cuisinart

15 lb. mushrooms, sliced 24 Ib. tofu

10c. green peppers, chopt 9 pkg. (27 lb.)frozen spinach

10 Ib. zucchini, diced olive oil folr sauteeing, etc.

2 bunches parsley, chopt 3c. kuzu, ground to powder

The night before:, Pull spinach from freezer to defrost.
Also, get you tofu out. Crumble it into the footed colander, let drain a little while. Then set colander in a big
steel bowl. Cover tofu with saran wrap. , coer with a soup-pot lid Put this contraption in the wlak-in and set
a heavy tub on top of it. Leave overnight.

Be sure to assign some of the veggie detail to a prep person. Remember, your sauce will need onions,
peppers, etc. beyond what this recipe lists above.

In the morning, get sauce started right away, and set a pot of water, lightly oiled and salted, on the

stove to boil. This will be for cooking noodles.

Make marinade for tofu:

4c, tamar VAD) honey

2¢. red wine /4c. garlic powder
Le. olive oil 2T. oregano

4/2 ¢. wine vinegar 4c. chili powder
21, fennel seed, ground

Put tofu in 4 oiled casserole pans and pour marinade over it. Mix well. Bake tofu in convection oven at 250°
for about an hour, stirring once or twice with a spatula during baking.

Saute onion, green pepper, and mushrooms, using big skillet and a little olive oil. It helps to sprinkle
same salt on the mushrooms (about 1 t. per skilletful), thereby getting excess juice out quickly. Drain
mushrooms if all juice does not boil off during sauteeing. Reserve all cooked vegies in Big Bertha.

Drain spinach in a colander and SQEEZE out as much water & juice as you can. Put spinch in Bertha
also.

Roast almonds on a cookie sheet. Takes about 10 minutes in a 275° convection oven, or a 400° Vulcan.

Cook noodles as you would for any other lasagna, doing two batches of 5 lb. each. Simmer about 10
minutes till tender yet still chewy, then dump entire pot in footed colander set in sink. Rinse with cold water,
drain, oil lightly. Get a second pot of water on the stove for the next batch. Set cooked noodles aside till
ready to use.

When tofu is ready (shoud be browned, slightly crispy & delicious) , put that into Bertha, too. Add
your chopt parsley, zucchini, roastd alminds.

Use the spice grinder to reduce kuzu root starch to fine powder (grinder will hold about */2 c. kuzu
root ata time). Add to the mixture in Bertha, mixing in VERY thoroughly. Add also:

1/4¢. celery seed

Zt. sage

1T. nutmeg

2 t. rosemary, ground

Taste. Add salt if you think necessary. Rememger, this stuff takes the place of all the cheese, etc. in traditional
lasagnas, and cheese is pretty salty.,

New RIVERSIDE CAFE COOKBOOK — DRAFT — PAGE 29

1 bunch scallions olive oil or soy oil for sauteeing

2 Ig.. red bell peppers 2T. dark sesame oil” “
1lg. green bell peppers lots of brown rice

Drain the tofu in a colander and cut into 1” cubes. Place in oiled casserole pan for an hour at 250°, or
until crispy (resembling deep-fried tofu). During baking, stir the cubes up a couple of times with a spatula.

Chop the bigger mushrooms in half, leave the smaller ones whole. Cut peppers into big chunks,
celery in long diagonal slices. The scallions should be cut in slivers about 2” long. Peel the daikons and cut
them in quarters lengthwise, then slice the quarters very thin. The result will be little triangular bits.

Sautee mushrooms and peppers in olive and dark sesame oil. Cook peppers only until slightly
tenderized and their color brightens. You want to keep that sumptuous color! Saute mushrooms until they
have shrunk to half their original size, and get dark and tender. You can sprinkle a little salt over the
mushrooms while they are cooking to control excess juice. Blanch celery by immersing in boiling water, then
when water comes back up to a boil again, cook celery for 1 minute, remove, drain, and rinse under cool
water. Leave daikons and scallions raw. Put all vegies in a large bowl.

1/2c¢.kuzu
4 /4c. rice wine
1/4.c, wine vinegar
Whisk this into the boiling sauce. It will take only minutes for the kuzu to do its work. Sauce should
be a rich, clear dark brown, and very thick. Add more water now, watching consistency. You want the sauce
to stay pretty thick,about as thick as custard is before chilling, since you'll be pouring it over a bunch of wet
vegies soon. Add currants. Taste, and adjust seasoning if you think it necessary.

Add baked tofu to the cooked vegies. Pour the sauce in and mix well. Allow to cool a little while, stirring
frequently. This dish is best served over rice A handful of crunchy chow mein noodles on top is optional.
Garnish with scallions spinkled on top. It may also be served as a Lo Mein by substituting cooked Udon
noodles for the rice.

3. onions (chopped) 4 eggs
11/4c¢. can tomatoes, drained 1 head garlic, minced
1 box filo dough 1 Ib..additional butter for brushing on filo
salt and pepper to taste

First start garbonzos, cook for 2” -3 hours until tender.

Saute onions and garlic in some of the butter, when they are clear, reserve them. Drain liquid from
the cooked beans and mash them with a pastry cutter or large fork. Add olive oil, then the wine, and beat till
blended. Add eggs, one at a time. Beat till fairly smooth and fluffy.

Mix reserved vegies, bean mixture and tomatoes(be sure they’re drained really well), crumbled feta cheese,
and chopped fresh cilantro.

With a big rubber spatula, sturdy spoon or, human’s oldest tool, THE HANDS, mix all filling
ingrediants thoroughly. Taste for salt. Feta cheese is pretty salty, so you may not need any. Depends, too, on
whether the beans were salted when they were cooked. Add a dash of pepper if you choose.

If this mixture appears too wet, you can add a few cups of unbleached white flour to it without
spoiling the taste or texture. But the best way to avoid this problem is to be cautious when adding liquids
during the mixing stage Add the oil, wine, etc. gradually

Melt the 4 lb. of butter you will use for laying.

See recipe for Cheese Tyropitas. Follow exactly the same procedure to wrap filling in the filo leaves.

CORN MEAL MUFFINS (NON-DAIRY)

Yield: 1 dozen

17/26 cornmeal

14/26 white flour

5 t. baking powder
pinch of salt

L/D +t nutmeg

2/3/4c. honey

2¢. soymilk

17/3. corn or safflower oil

This recipe can be made by hand, no equipment neccesary.

In a large bowl, gather dry ingrediants and blend together thoroughly, using fingers.

In another bowl, mix wet ingrediants; using whisk to blend well. If you choose to use the larger
amount of honey, decrease soy milk by '/4c.. For variety, you can use some fruit juice as a substitute for part
of the soymlk.

Pour wet stuff into dry stuff, and use rubber spatula to mix. Do not over-work batter. Stir only until
it is uniformly moist. Don’t worry too much about lumps. You can use a heavy-gauge whisk to break up the
stubborn ones, if neccesary.

With a pastry brush, lightly oil the flat tops of your muffin tins. Do use muffin-papers, but before

Batter should be stiff enough that you can use a scoop to portion it into the cups.

Bake at 400° for about 25 minutes, until golden brown and crispy on top. An inserted toothpick will

1 Tbl cup garlic powder 1 tsp. chili powder
dash black pepper salt to taste
1/4 tsp cayenne
2 large tomatoes, chopped in small chunks
1 bunch scallions, chopped

USE ONLY RIPE AVOCADOS —WHEN READY, THEY ARE SOMEWHAT TENDER IF PRESSED
GENTLY WITH YOUR FINGERS.

Squeeze juice from lemons first, and strain it. Set aside in small container. Remove pits from avocados
and scoop out the flesh with a soup spoon. Put it in a large bowl and pour some of the lemon juice over it,
little by little, as you go along pitting and scooping. This helps prevent the avocados from discoloring.

When all the avocados are done, add spices, and the rest of the lemon juice to the bowl, and mash
thoroughly with the potato masher. Taste for saltiness and flavor. If you’re happy with it, add tomatoes and
scallions and fold them in with a rubber spatula.

VARIATIONS: For a richer guacamole, add sour cream. This also will extend the recipe somewhat,
If you want a spicy guac, add a few spoonfuls of Killer Relish.

Try coriander with your spices, or even some chopped fresh cilantro.

Try adding yogurt (decrease the amount of lemon juice).

1c tomato paste

1/2 head garlic, minced 172 ¥ marjoram

1c carrots, finely diced 1. oregano

Le celery,” “ “ 1t. salt

(*/2 c. romano cheese, opt.) De black pepper

Saute onions and garlic in olive oil. When they become translucent, add the carrots and celery. Allow to
cook awhile, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Add a little water or wine if vegies seem inclined to
stick to the bottom. Use a flame-tamer to be safe.

Add tomato products and seasonings. Stir well. Bring to boil slowly, then turn flame down and allow to
simmer until needed. If you are using the romano cheese, add it just before you are going to serve or use the
sauce.

This is a very simple sauce that has any number of possible variations. Here are a few suggestions:

*Replace marjoram with 2 T. basil and 2 T. thyme

*Add 11/2 t. crushed chilis (may want to decrease black pepper)

*Add 1/2 c. red wine in place of 11/2 c. diced tomatoes

*Add 1 t. dill

*Substitute 1 c. extra chopped onions for the garlic

* Add sauteed mushroom slices and a little tomato paste for thicker

sauce.
Almost any seasoning may be used, but limiting the number to 4 or 5 types makes for a more distinct flavor.

ED ground cloves water to appropriate consistency
1/2 t. crushed dry chilis (probably about '/4 cup)
1/2. black pepper iT. wine vinegar ~

(cayenne or jalapenos optional)

Heat oil in a 5-gal. pot, add spices. Allow to simmer at least ten minutes, stirring with a whisk. Use
flame-tamer to prevent sticking. Add chopped onions and peppers; when they’re clear and tender, add masa
harina cup by cup and continue whisking with a heavy-gauge whisk till you have a very thick roux.

Let the roux cook for a little while on a low flame, stirring often. Then begin adding canned tomato
products, water, wine, vinegar. You may raise your flame to medium-hot as you bring the sauce slowly up
to a boil, whisking frequently.

Reduce flame to low; let sauce simmer for at least 1/2 hour. Taste; adjust salt, seasonings, sweetness to
suit you and your main dish. It should be quite thick in consistency; in fact you have a little leeway with your
yield,
because as the sauce sits on the stove it will get increasingly thick, and you may find it necessary (not to
mention convenient) to add more water, or an extra can of tomato sauce.

This sauce is not only basic to enchiladas, but serves as the matrix of a number of Mexican dishes. It’s also
good ladled over burritos, if you’re making a special kind and serving them as a main dish.

1T. spike 1 t.basil
Lt. cumin 1 t.oregano
1t nutmeg 1T. spike (more if you want)
1/8 t. ground fennel pinch of fennel (opt)

pinch of cinnamon

Saute onions and garlic in the oil in a pot. When they are tender, gradually add flour and stir with a
whisk until you have a thick, smooth paste over a very low flame. Let the roux cook a few minutes, then
begin adding the soy milk (cold) and the apple juice. If you decide to use wine , simmer separately in a small
saucepan for awhile. Not only does this take away the winey “edge”, it also kills off any organisms that may
be in the wine that could curdle the soymilk.

Add seasonings. Continue to whisk frequently, use a flame-tamer if you have one. Begin to add
cold liquids gradually. Sauce will get thicker after each addition.

You can increase the thickness by decreasing liquids, or by adding ground cashews that have been

ground to a smooth paste.

You can use this sauce in many ways: over a non-dairy entree, or if you add a bunch of steamed or
sauteed vegies it can be a pasta sauce, or serve over brown & wild rice.

APPLE CRISP

9" X 9" lg. crisp, serves 12

Filling:

10-11 C. chopped apples ( and other fruit of your choice - blues,

pineapple,bananas etc. )

Topping:

21/2C. oats

1C. rice flour

1/2 Tbls. cinnamon

1/2 tsp. nutmeg

1/2C. oil

2/3 C. honey
Preheat oven to 375.

Put the prepared filling into a 9" X 13" pan and press down evenly. Prepare the topping.

Mix the oats, rice flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl ( you can use the same bowl you just used
for the fruit ). Add the oil and mix thoroughly - you want to coat all the oats with oil before adding the
honey. Add the honey and mix thoroughly.

Sprinkle the topping over the fruit and press down lightly. Make sure the fruit is completey covered. Cover
the crisp with foil and bake for about 45 minutes ( or longer or shorter depending on how cooked you want
the fruit to be ). Then remove the foil and bake for about 15 minutes more, or until the topping is lightly
browned.

note: The filling is usually mostly apples ( or all apples ) with some other fruit of your choice. The other fruit
will usually account for only 2 1/2 — 4 cups of the total filling. The filling may be spiced up with some
cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, honey, or whatever strikes your fancy, although it is usually sweet enough to
forgo the added honey. If you use fruit that is particularly juicy, you might add about 1/2 cup of oats and a
sprinkling of rice flour in order to help soak up the excess juices produced by cooking.

HUNGARIAN WALNUT TORTE

( from Book of Great Desserts - M. Heatter )

Makes 1 tortes, serves 12

8 0z. walnuts

5 T. cornstarch

3/4 tsp. baking powder

7 eggs

3/4C. sugar
1 T.+2 tsp. lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Prepare three, 8 1/2" single-layer cake pans by buttering, lining the bottoms with wax paper, then buttering
the wax paper and dusting with flour.

(Note: Avoid buttering the sides as this will help the cakes rise. )

Grind the walnuts to a fine meal in a food processor or by hand. You can mix in the cornstarch and baking
powder while grinding the walnuts, or you can mix them into the finished walnut meal in a bowl. In either
case, great care must be taken not to over-grind the walnuts, or you will have walnut butter instead of walnut
meal.

Separate the eggs, making sure the egg whites get put into a clean bowl with absolutely no yolk.

In a mixer or food processor, beat the yolks and sugar for 10 minutes at high speed until very thick. On low

New RIVERSIDE CAFE COOKBOOK — DRAFT — PAGE 47
speed add the lemon juice and mix until smooth.

Transfer to a larger bowl and stir in the nut mixture.

Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff, but not dry ( don’t overdo it ).

The yolk mixture will be very stiff, so lighten it a bit by actually stirring in a little of the beaten egg whites.
Then gradually fold in the balance of the whites. (Note: A clean hand, with the fingers spread apart, works
really well for folding in the whites. In any case, regardless of the method used, it’s important not to over-
incorporate the whites - fold them until they are just barely mixed in. )

Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared pans. The layers will be thin, so weighing them will actually
give the most accurate results ( about

8 - 9 oz. per layer ).

Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until tops spring back when lightly touched in the center and/or cakes come away
from sides of pans. Remove from oven, let cool for five minutes and then remove from pans to cooling racks.
Let cool completely before frosting.

These get made into a 3-layer cake, and can be filled and iced in a variety of ways. Flavored whip cream or a
standard buttercream work well.

RICHARD’S GENOISE RECIPE

3/4 lb. butter

1T. vanilla

18 eges

3k: sugar

3c. sifted flour(unbleached white)****(1 c. pre-sifted)
Li/2¢, nuts (finely chopt, opt.)

1. Melt and cool butter and add vanilla when cool.

2. Meanwhile stir eggs and sugar together (whisk together lightly for 30+ strokes) and warm over pot of
simmering (not boiling) water until it looks like a bright yellow syrup—don’t actually let it cook, the purpose
it to warm it past lukewarm so more volume of air can be whipped in. (It’s a good idea to stir it by hand a
couple times while warming).

3. Now that it’s warm, pour into big Hobart with whisk attachment and whip it for 10-15 minutes, till it’s
roughly triple in volume. (THis is a good time to butter your pans. Either 6-9” spingforms or 8-8 1/4” torte
layer pans).

4, Remove bowl from Hobart-machine and alternately fold in 3 cups of flour and the melted-cooled butter.
It’s best to fold this is with your bare-naked hand and to do it as lightyly as possibe to avoid breaking air-
bubbles. If desired, at this point, add the nuts.

5. Divide among your cake tins and bake in Vulcan 350° for 25-30 minutes, until cakes begin to pull slightly
away from sides of pans—but don’t over bake them. Remember to adjust baking time for the sizes of
pans.you decide to use (SHOULD INCLUDE DIFFERENT TEMPS FOR DIFFERENT PANS). And don’t
move them or disturb for first 20 minutes of baking time. This recipe can also be baked on large cookie sheet
for paves or jelly-roll type desserts (again, adjust times and watch carefully).

6. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before turning out onto wire cake cooking rack to cool
completely.

7. Now, you can sprinkle with liquers, lightyly, if you wish. Fill with flavored whipped cream fillings, or
pastry cream or buttercreams; cover with glazes or whatever you want.

VIENNESE CHOCOLATE ALMOND
TORTE

( A.K.A. “QUEEN MOTHER’S TORTE” FROM BOOK OF GREAT DESSERTS, M. HEATTER )

 

One single layer torte - 12 pieces

6 OZ. semi-sweet chocolate
6 OZ. butter

3/4C. white sugar

6 eggs ( separated )

6 0z almonds

Preheat oven to 375 F. Prepare a 9-inch spring-form pans by buttering the bottoms, then lining the
bottoms with cake pan liners, and buttering the liners. Avoid getting butter on the sides of pans. Dust lightly
with flour or ground bread crumbs.

Melt chocolate ( which should be broken into small pieces ) in the top of a small double boiler. When it is
melted, remove from heat to cool slightly.

Meanwhile, ground the almonds ( hazelnuts work well also ) in the food- processor to a fine meal, but
don’t over-grind or you will get almond butter.

Separate the eggs, putting the whites into a large, clean, stainless bowl. Take care not to get any yolks in
with the whites.

With a mixer, cream the butter, then add the sugar and beat at moderately high speed for several minutes,
scraping the bow] as necessary. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating until each addition is thoroughly
incorporated. (Note: At this time you may beat in some extract - vanilla, almond, rum etc. - if desired. ) Beat
in the chocolate. Stir in the ground almonds, scraping the bow] with a rubber spatula as necessary to keep
mixture smooth.

Beat the whites with a dash of salt until they hold a definite shape, or are stiff but not dry. (Note: Using a
large, flexible wire whisk works well and gives you a good workout. If you use an electric mixer, be sure not
to overbeat - you don’t want the whites too stiff and dry. )

Stir a large spoonful of the whites into the chocolate mixture to loosen it up slightly, then carefully fold in
the remainder of the whites in several additions until just incorporated. (Note: Using a freshly washed
hand, with the fingers slightly spread, works best, but a rubber spatula can also be used. ) Turn the mixture
into the prepared pans. If necessary, level the top by rotating the pan briskly from side to side, or carefully
spreading with a rubber spatula.

Bake for 20 minutes at 375 degrees. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake for an additional
50 minutes. (Total baking time is 1 hour and 10 minutes. ) Do not overbake. Cake should remain soft and
moist in the center.

Remove cakes from oven and place on a wire rack. Let stand for about 20 minutes. Remove sides of the
spring-forms (carefully cutting around the edges first, if necessary ). Place another wire rack over the cakes
and carefully invert. Remove bottom of forms and paper lining. Cover with another rack and invert again to
cool right side up. The cakes will be about 1 3/4 inches high and will have fallen in the middle ( don’t worry,
this is normal ).

When the cakes have cooled completely, trim the high edges off to level the tops, then transfer to
cardboard cake circles, bottom up. Place strips of wax paper under the edges to protect the liners while icing
the cakes.

ICING FOR CHOCOLATE ALMOND TORTE

1/2 heavy cream
1/27 instant coffee (optional)
8 semi-sweet choocolate

Heat the cream in a medium saucepan over moderate heat until it begins to boil. Still over heat, add the
instant coffee and stir briskly with a wire whisk until dissolved. Add the chocolate, which should be broken
into small chunks, and stir over the heat for another minute until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.
Transfer to a small bow! to stop the cooking.

Let mixture stand for 15 minutes or more, stirring occasionally until it reaches room temperature. Stir and
pour over the tops of the prepared cake. Use a long metal spatula to smooth the tops, letting a bit of the icing
run down the sides. Gently smooth the sides, completely covering the cake. After a few minutes, remove the
wax paper strips, pulling each one out by the narrow end before the icing hardens. Sprinkling finely chopped
almonds over the tops is a nice touch. Refrigerate.

COCONUT CREAM PIE

6 pies at7 pcs. / pie ? / piece

Filling:
4C. white sugar
2. cornstarch
20C. milk
24 egg yolks (save whites for meringue)
1/2 |b. soft butter
2 Ib. flaked coconut (save 1/2 lb. for topping)
3T. vanilla
Meringue Topping:
24 egg whites
2 tsp. cream of tartar
2 tsp. cornstarch
pinch salt
21/4C. white sugar

Prepare and bake six single crusts beforehand. Use regular pie crust, or coconut flake crust (see recipies ):
In a larger saucepan, mix sugar and cornstarch. Pour in the milk and cook over medium heat until it coats a
spoon thickly.

In a medium bowI, beat the egg yolks lightly. Stir a portion of the hot liquid into the yolks. When the yolks
have been warmed, pour them into the hot liquid, stirring until it is as thick as mayonnaise. ( Hint: A stiff
whisk works best for keeping out lumps - if lumps do occur you can always pour through the china cap. )
Remove from heat and blend in butter. Stir in 3/4 of the coconut and the vanilla. Allow the mixture to cool
before pouring into shells.

Preheat oven to 325.
Beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, cornstarch and salt. Beat until whites come to a soft

peak when the beater is lifted.

Add sugar, 1/4 C. at a time, while beating constantly. The peaks should form stiff, glossy peaks.

Pour cooled filling into the baked shells.

Pile meringue on the pies, touching it to the crust edges to seal. Give them a good swirl, leaving several
standing peaks, and top with reserved coconut.

Bake until meringue is lightly browned ( about 10 minutes ).

Refrigerate before serving.

Put apple chunks in a soup pot**, along with the first 3-4 cups of juice, honey, salt, cinnamon. Bring toa boil,
then turn down quicly to a gentle simmer. You don’t want to cook the fruit too much at all—just allow it to
get a little bit tender. Add the dissolved cornstarch and, stirring frequently, let come up to a boil again; then
remove from flame. (Don’t let the bottom of the pot stick & scorch. If it helps youto use a flame-tamer, DO
IT. Add dried fruit. last

You can let the cooked fruit stand for awhile before using; in face, it’s good to let it cool down
somewhat before putting in pie shells & baking. You should have your seven pie shells pre-baked 5-6
minutes already done, but you can make the topping while apple are cooking, or cooling.

33/4C. 5G 61/4C. whipping cream
11/2 t. 2 t. 21/26 vanilla
Preheat oven to 325.

Prepare the crust: Mix grahams, cinnamon, and melted butter. Press firmly into small pie tins and
refridgerate briefly. Then put into preheated oven and bake until just starting to brown (don’t let get brown,
though). Refridgerate again until cold. Heat cream in small saucepan until it starts to bubble and add
chopped chocolate. Stir until smooth and let cool briefly. Pour chocolate mixture into prepared crusts and
spread evenly over the bottoms. Refridgerate until ready for the filling (chocolate must be hard before the
filling can be added).

Prepare the filling: Put egg yolks in a medium bow] and beat well. Add flour and beat into a paste. Then add
sugar, water, lemon juice, and lemon rind.Cook over - not in - boiling water until thickened, beating
frequently.( It takes a while to get properly thickened - be patient and cook until quite sure it won’t get any
thicker. ) Chill until cold ( an ice bath works fastest ). Whip the cream with the vanilla until very stiff.

Put the pies together by spreading half the whipped cream on the bottom, then spreading a layer of the lemon
filling over the whipped cream, and then spreading the remaining whipped cream over the top. Note: This
procedure is a little tricky. It is easiest if you make sure not to spread the lemon filling all the way to the edge,
and drop the whipped cream on top by spoonfuls

(especially around the edges ) before carefully spreading out with a frosting spreader. The top should be
completely covered with whipped cream.

Decorate with shaved semi-sweet chocolate and refridgerate immediately.

FRUIT-SWEETENED CAKES
(FORMERLY, HONEY)

(OR BANANA BREAD OR COFFEE-CAKE)

Use date-goo (the consistency of honey) to replace equal measurements of honey for cake recipes.
A combination of dates and orange juice.

When cake recipes call for sweet milk, substitute yogurt, sour cream, or a mixture of milk/yogurt
(or milk/sour cream)

Adjust leavening- for example, if it calls for 2 T. of baking powder substitute 2 t. baking soda.
This is important, as the cultured milk (and the OJ is the date-goo will react with the baking at

bowl ). Add eggs four-at-a-time and beat until smooth (don’t forget to scrape the bow]). Stir in the vanilla.
Pour into the prepared pans ( the large ones get a little more ), and smooth the top ( the filling should come to
about 1/4 inch from the top of the pan ). Bake for about 25 minutes or until just jelled in the center. ( The sides
will be slightly puffed up, but the top and crust should remain unbrowned. ) Remove from oven and let cool
for 20 to 30 minutes before putting the topping on.
