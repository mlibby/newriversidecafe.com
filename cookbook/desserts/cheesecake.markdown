Makes one cheesecake -- 8 slices -- in 9" pie pan

Preheat oven to 325&deg; 

## Crust

### Ingredients

*	4 tablespoons butter 
*	1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups crushed graham crackers 
*	1 teaspoon cinnamon 

### Directions

The graham crackers can be crushed using the small holed grinder on the large Hobart. Melt the butter. Mix the grahams with the cinnamon and then add the melted butter. Mix together well and press into 5 small and 3 large pie pans (ungreased). Use the smooth bottomed 1 cup measure for equally dividing the graham mixture (put a little more in the large pie tins) and for pressing the mixture. Chill for at least 15 minutes. 

## Cheesecake filling

### Ingredients

*	16 ounces cream cheese (2 boxes)
*	2 eggs 
*	<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cups honey 
*	1 teaspoon vanilla 

### Directions

Beat cream cheese in large Hobart until smooth and creamy, taking care to scrape the sides of the bowl often. Add honey and beat until smooth and fluffy (again, as always, taking care to scrape down the sides of the bowl). Add eggs four-at-a-time and beat until smooth (don't forget to scrape the bowl). Stir in the vanilla. Pour into the prepared pans (the large ones get a little more), and smooth the top (the filling should come to about 1/4 inch from the top of the pan). Bake for about 25 minutes or until just jelled in the center. (The sides will be slightly puffed up, but the top and crust should remain unbrowned.) Remove from oven and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before putting the topping on. 

## Topping

### Ingredients

*	8 ounces sour cream (1 small tub)
*	2 tablespoons honey 
*	<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla 

### Directions

Beat the sour cream with a whip until smooth and creamy and then beat in the honey and the vanilla. Gently pour evenly between the eight pans and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. Bake for 5 minutes ( no longer 

Remove the cheese cakes from oven and cut immediately ( 7 pcs. each for the small ones and 8 pcs. each for the large ones ). Refrigerate immediately. 

(The cheese cakes need at least four hours of refrigeration before being wrapped so as to allow the topping to firmly set up.) Don't forget to make labeled foils.
