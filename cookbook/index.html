<h1>About the Cookbook</h1>
<p>
  The cookbook is going to take a while to whip into shape for home cooking. The recipes we
  used in the Riv's kitchen were written to be useful in running a restaurant. So they
  reference machines the home cook probably doesn't have, like a Hobart mixer; the quantites
  are meant to feed a restaurant full of people for at least a whole day; and,
  most fun are the references to ingredient measures that were unique to the Riv, most
  notably the "yogi" which was the plastic container our yogurt came in and was reused
  as a general purpose container once it no longer had yogurt in it. At least that's
  how I remember it.
</p>
<p>
  I'm still going to have to figure out exactly how big a "yogi" was, because several
  recipes call for using a yogi of some ingredient.
</p>
<p>
  But the real fun will be in trying to actually make some of these recipes at more
  modest scale.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, I've <a href="/cookbook/scans/">scanned all the pages of the cookbook</a>,
  so that you can have a look at what I'm starting from. Luckily there's software to convert
  all those images to text, so I won't have to type them in by hand.
</p>
<p>
  Please <a href="mailto:m@mlibby.com">send me an email</a> if you use any of these recipes
  and have reduced the ingredients down to a more reasonable cookbook size, if you have
  any comments on what the directions <em>should</em> say, or anything at all, really.
</p>
<p>
  Just knowing that anyone is out there using these recipes would be a great morale boost!
