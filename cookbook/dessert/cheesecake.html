    Note: I have tested this, and the time/temperature are WAY off, vastly undercooked. I'll be trying again with a higher temp <em>and</em> longer time. I have a hard time recalling, but I have this vague notion that the baking ovens were convection
    ovens, which would have cooked much more quickly than my totally average home oven. I've adjusted the crust ingredients a tad from my initial recalculations.

<h2 id="cheesecake-filling">Cheesecake filling</h2>
<h3 id="ingredients-1">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>16 ounces cream cheese (2 boxes)</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup honey</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions-1">Directions</h3>
<p>
    Beat cream cheese in large Hobart until smooth and creamy, taking care to scrape the sides of the bowl often. Add honey and beat until smooth and fluffy (again, as always, taking care to scrape down the sides of the bowl). Add eggs four-at-a-time and
    beat until smooth (don’t forget to scrape the bowl). Stir in the vanilla. Pour into the prepared pans (the large ones get a little more), and smooth the top (the filling should come to about 1/4 inch from the top of the pan). Bake for about 25
    minutes or until just jelled in the center. (The sides will be slightly puffed up, but the top and crust should remain unbrowned.) Remove from oven and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before putting the topping on.

<h2 id="topping">Topping</h2>
<h3 id="ingredients-2">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces sour cream (1 small tub)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions-2">Directions</h3>
<p>
    Beat the sour cream with a whip until smooth and creamy and then beat in the honey and the vanilla. Gently pour evenly between the eight pans and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. Bake for 5 minutes ( no longer
</p>
<p>
    Remove the cheese cakes from oven and cut immediately ( 7 pcs. each for the small ones and 8 pcs. each for the large ones ). Refrigerate immediately.
</p>
<p>
    (The cheese cakes need at least four hours of refrigeration before being wrapped so as to allow the topping to firmly set up.) Don’t forget to make labeled foils.
