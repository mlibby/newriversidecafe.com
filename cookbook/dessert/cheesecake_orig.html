<p>
  Makes 5 sm. and 3 lg. at $1.75 per slice (1/1/87)
</p>
<p>
  Preheat oven to 325
</p>
<p>
  Crust:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb. butter</li>
  <li>10 cups crushed graham crackers</li>
  <li>2 Tbls. cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The graham crackers can be crushed using the small holed grinder on the large Hobart. Melt the butter. Mix the
  grahams with the cinnamon and then add the melted butter. Mix together well and press into 5 small and 3 large pie
  pans (ungreased). Use the smooth bottomed 1 cup measure for equally dividing the graham mixture (put a little more in
  the large pie tins) and for pressing the mixture. Chill for at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
  Cheesecake filling:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>7 lbs. cream cheese ( 2 1/3 boxes)</li>
  <li>14 eggs</li>
  <li>3 cups honey</li>
  <li>2 Tbls. vanilla</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Beat cream cheese in large Hobart until smooth and creamy, taking care to scrape the sides of the bowl often. Add
  honey and beat until smooth and fluffy ( again, as always, taking care to scrape down the sides of the bowl ). Add
  eggs four-at-a-time and beat until smooth (don’t forget to scrape the bowl). Stir in the vanilla. Pour into the
  prepared pans ( the large ones get a little more ), and smooth the top ( the filling should come to about 1/4 inch
  from the top of the pan ). Bake for about 25 minutes or until just jelled in the center. ( The sides will be slightly
  puffed up, but the top and crust should remain unbrowned. ) Remove from oven and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before
  putting the topping on.

<p>
  Topping:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 yogi sour cream</li>
  <li>1 cup honey</li>
  <li>1 Tbls.vanilla</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Beat the sour cream with a whip until smooth and creamy and then beat in the honey and the vanilla. Gently pour
  evenly between the eight pans and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula. Bake for 5 minutes ( no longer</p>

<p>Remove the cheese cakes from oven and cut imediately ( 7 pcs. each for the small ones and 8 pcs. each for the large
  ones ). Refridgerate immediately.</p>

<p>(The cheese cakes need at least four hours of refridgeration before being wrapped so as to allow the topping to
  firmly set up.) Don’t forget to make labeled foils.</p>
